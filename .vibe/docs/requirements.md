# Requirements Document: Personal Todo App

## Project Overview
A minimal, personal-use todo application designed as a technical showcase for the db-ux frontend library. The application prioritizes simplicity and complete offline functionality.

## REQ-1: Todo Management
**User Story:** As a personal user, I want to create and manage todos so that I can track my personal tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN user creates a todo THEN the system SHALL store todo text, optional due date, and optional tags
- WHEN user views todos THEN the system SHALL display them in a simple list view
- WHEN user marks a todo complete THEN the system SHALL update its status
- WHEN user edits a todo THEN the system SHALL save the changes locally
- WHEN user deletes a todo THEN the system SHALL remove it from storage

## REQ-2: Tag-Based Filtering
**User Story:** As a personal user, I want to filter todos by tags so that I can focus on specific categories of tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN user applies a tag filter THEN the system SHALL show only todos with that tag
- WHEN user clears filters THEN the system SHALL show all todos
- WHEN user adds tags to a todo THEN the system SHALL make those tags available for filtering

## REQ-3: Offline Functionality
**User Story:** As a personal user, I want the app to work completely offline so that I can manage todos without internet connectivity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN user accesses the app offline THEN the system SHALL load from local storage
- WHEN user creates/edits todos offline THEN the system SHALL persist changes to IndexedDB
- WHEN user refreshes the app offline THEN the system SHALL maintain all data and state

## REQ-4: Technical Showcase
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to demonstrate db-ux library capabilities so that I can showcase modern frontend development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL use db-ux as the primary frontend library
- WHEN the app handles data THEN the system SHALL use IndexedDB for persistence
- WHEN the app is reviewed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate clean, minimal implementation

## REQ-5: Scope Boundaries
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain minimal scope so that the technical showcase remains focused.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL NOT include user authentication
- The system SHALL NOT include data synchronization
- The system SHALL NOT include complex organization beyond tags
- The system SHALL NOT include search functionality
- The system SHALL NOT include bulk operations
- The system SHALL NOT include notifications or reminders
