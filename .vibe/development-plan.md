## Document

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Core implementation is complete and functional
- [ ] All planned features have been implemented
- [ ] Code is tested and working as expected
- [ ] Implementation follows the architectural decisions
- [ ] Application meets the requirements from ideation phase

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Key Decisions
- **Target Audience**: Personal use only (single user)
- **Context**: Personal life management
- **Platform**: Web-based with complete offline capability (IndexedDB)
- **Scope**: Minimal viable features - technical showcase focus
- **Organization**: Tag-based filtering only
- **Collaboration**: Single user only
- **Core Features**: Todo text, due dates, tags
- **UI**: Simple list view with tag filtering
- **Technical Showcase**: db-ux frontend library demonstration
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for complete offline functionality
- **Architecture**: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite (following vue-showcase patterns)
- **Components**: Using db-ux layout (Card, Stack, Section), input (Input, Checkbox), action (Button), and display (Tag, Icon) components
- **Data Model**: Simple Todo interface with id, text, completed, dueDate, tags, timestamps
- **Build Strategy**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Testing**: Minimal testing approach for showcase purposes

## Notes
- This is intended as a technical showcase for db-ux library
- Local-first architecture with IndexedDB storage
- Explicitly avoiding all features beyond: todo text, due dates, tags, and tag filtering
- Focus on simplicity and offline capability
